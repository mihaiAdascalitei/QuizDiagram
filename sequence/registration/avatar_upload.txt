Feature: Upload avatar
The user should be in the registering step and grant access to accessing the local files

Scenario: Pick image from gallery
	Given that I am registering and I have granted access to file reading
	When I click the upload button
	And I select a picture from gallery
	Then the selected picture is uploaded

Scenario: Pick image without grant
	Given that I am logged in
	When I click the upload button
	And I select a picture from gallery
	Then I receive null because the permission is not grant
	And the picture is not uploaded
